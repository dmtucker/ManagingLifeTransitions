	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Stress! Is It Consuming You?</span><br />
	As life's demands increase, our ability to manage stress diminishes.
	We can become chronically stressed which affects our moods, our relationships, our motivation and ultimately our health.<br />
	You can turn stress on its ear by using the following techniques:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">Exercise</span><br />
		Take a walk during your lunch hour or afternoon break. Get out in the sunshine. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Stretch!</span><br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">Have a Positive Attitude</span><br />
		Have the &quot;Glass is half-full&quot; rather than half-empty philosophy.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">Be Flexible</span><br />
		Learn to just <span style="font-weight:bold;">BE!</span><br />
