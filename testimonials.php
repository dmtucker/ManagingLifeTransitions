<p style="font-style:italic;">
	Dear Joyce,<br />
	<br />
	From the moment I walked through the door of your office I felt a connection with you.
	You have a very calming, caring and genuine sincere air about you. 
	I was able to open up to you like I've never done with anyone before.
	It was amazing in that first meeting how you were able to bring me to the core of my fears and anxiety. 
	I knew then that I had come to the right place!<br />
	<br />
	You have opened my mind and calmed my fears.
	You have given me the tools to overcome self confidence, confrontation and public speaking issues, and so much more. 
	Your insight brought me to the realization of how those fears affected so many aspects of my life that kept me from moving forward.
	You helped me to accept myself for the way I am, and made me realize that it's okay to be 'me.'
	I am now on the path of self-healing and I truly feel empowered.<br />
	<br />
	Since we last met, I have interviewed for that job I spoke to you about and it went very well.
	I have offered my services to teach a leadership class on the process of my work (can you believe it?).
	I feel confident, and I'm very excited.<br />
	<br />
	I want you to know that this has made a major impact on my life.
	I will forever be grateful to you.
	Thank you for helping me.<br />
	<br />
	Best Regards,<br />

	Your &quot;help&quot; is awesome! With your help, I have been able to get past many problems that have bothered me for years.<br />
	<br />
	Two &quot;thank you's&quot; to report: I unplugged the clock radio that was my &quot;main source&quot; of time watching, and I have been sleeping better. 
	When I turn off the light at night, I tell myself that it doesn't matter whether or not I go right to sleep.
	If I need to be somewhere in the morning, I set my alarm, so I know that whatever happens, I will not &quot;oversleep&quot;.<br />
	<br />
	I sat in my backyard the other afternoon and thought about Leo.
	It was wonderful not to have the &quot;punch in the stomach&quot; guilt feelings after so many years! 
	I had nostalgic feelings, and of course, some sadness that Leo is no longer with me, but it was not the awful guilt that has haunted me for so long.
	Thank you again for all your help!<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">ANXIETY DISORDER</span>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
	I came to Joyce because I had tried every other alternative out there to help me deal with the anxiety disorder I was diagnosed with.
	The medication alone was not the answer. 
	The first session was like a Miracle.
	I felt &quot;something&quot; happen inside me, then the second visit, more calming changes.
	She provided me with the tools I needed to help reduce my anxiety and manage my life again.
	She was there for me when no one else was.
	Thank you Joyce from the bottom of my heart, you will ALWAYS, be in my prayers...<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">EMOTIONAL STABILITY</span>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
	You have helped me on countless occasions for a variety of emotional and physical sticking points in my life.
	Not only do your sessions feel like a mini vacation, you have done more for me than any medical modality.
	Thank you for your commitment to this alternative form of treatment.<br />
	&quot;Simply the Best!&quot;<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">PHOBIAS</span>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
	Back in 2003, Joyce Freeman actually CURED me of my life long fear of flying!
	That for me was tangible evidence that hypnotherapy works!!!!
	And very often times you can start to feel some immediate results.
	Since that time I see Joyce on a regular basis for everything from depression and anxiety to quitting drinking coffee! 
	She is also able to provide me with some valuable tools that I can use on my own.
	I've even brought my 8 year old daughter to her as she also exhibits issues with anxiety! 
	Joyce has become a dear and trusted friend and believe me, there's no problem she can't fix!!
	Joyce has truly changed my life by helping me get to the root of a problem and work it through inside of myself.<br />

<hr />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">RELAXATION</span>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
	I came to see Joyce to experience her work in the area of relaxation.
	I have found that when the body and mind are relaxed, I am able to gain more clarity on life's issues and thus make decisions that are more in tune with my personal vision.
	So a session with Joyce is such a treat to myself.
	Her voice was soothing, and the words that flowed out of her during the relaxation session were the words that I personally affirmed and connected to.
	I'd definitely encourage anyone to treat oneself and hear Joyce Freeman's words of relaxation.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">WEIGHT LOSS</span><br />
<p style="font-style:italic;">
	Joyce is the warmest, most comfortable person I have ever had the good fortune to meet.
	She makes me feel totally safe and secure while helping me resolve my problems. 
	Her technique seems almost like magic because it is so easy and effective.
	She has helped me face and solve fears and problems that I did not even realize I had. 
	Through her, I have learned to handle anger like an adult, to be able to go to sleep quickly every night, and most importantly, how to forgive... others and myself. 
	In fact, she is wonderful, and best of all, totally EFFECTIVE.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">SELF-CONFIDENCE</span>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
	Joyce have helped me so greatly in changing &quot;my mind and my life&quot;.
	I had tried numerous weight loss programs, with little success.
	I can remember after my first session feeling energized and ready to make the life changing commitment!
	My mental obsession with food decreased just days after my first session. 
	I had felt powerless prior to seeing you.
	Now, six sessions later, I see things differently, or really, I think things differently.
	I truly know it is due to seeking your help to change my thinking, not only about food, but about how I viewed myself.
	The techniques you use, the genuine care you showed me, and the love of what you do shines through greatly.<br />
	Thank You so much for starting me on the road to a better life and giving me the tools and understanding of the power I have to change my life.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">HAPPINESS</span>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
	I don't know if I can express the wonderful feelings that I have been getting since coming to you.
	To know that I am okay and the way I look is okay. 
	I have such a sense of peaceful happiness inside.
	Thank you so much for your healing spirit and for helping me to get back in touch with spirit.<br />

	You are a &quot;priceless&quot; person in my life.
	I feel that most of the strides I have made in my personal evolution are thanks to you.
	You are one of the kindest, most insightful, and spiritual people I have ever known.
	I am very grateful for your services and friendship.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">STRESS</span>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
	I wanted to thank you again for the session last week.
	The relaxed state lasted for quite a long time.
	The session itself and your tips on relaxing and balancing came in handy last Thursday.
	I had to prepare for a potentially heated discussion with my counterpart at work.
	I remained calm, cool, and collected.
	I don't think I would have been as grounded and confident without your help.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">LIFE CHALLENGES</span>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
	While going through the following major life changes: selling my home, moving, son starting middle school in a new location,
	a job search after being laid off, and unemployed for 6 months&mdash;a single mom to top it off.
	Re-entering the job market, I noticed I just wasn't myself and there were stumbling blocks preventing me from interviewing successfully.<br />
	My sessions with Joyce dissolved the blocks, and my interviews turned into job offers after two visits.
	Joyce certainly helped me with managing my life transitions.<br />

<p style="font-style:italic;">
	The spring of 2010 proved to be a most transformational and pivotal point in my adult life.
	I had reached the point of no return and was desperately seeking a new path and a new life, so I could breathe new life into a path that was a true reflection of my self.
	Well, I found Joyce's name as I was doing an internet search and reached out to her. 
	I truly believe in the old adage, "The teacher comes when the student is ready."
	I was soo ready to find Joyce and in working with Joyce, I found a catalyst, guide and unending source of support in my self growth and transformation.
	This was a few months ago in the beautiful sunny San Francisco bay area, and I have since found my way back to myself and my home.
	I rediscovered a source of strength, calm and self awareness that transmuted time, space and distance and learned to trust myself and my inner knowing again. 
	As a result of this work, I am like the butterfly who emerges from the cocoon.
	Looking back, I would have never guessed at the inner resilience and wisdom that would take me through this transformation,
	but I am eternally grateful to Joyce for serving as a guide, counselor, mentor, and most importantly a friend throughout the most difficult stages
	and never failing to see the greater truth in evey situation.
	She is truly a source of inspiration, goodness, and light for those who also are ready to seek themselves first. 
	Now, I know that the challenges that were put in front of me were meant to teach me to have absolute faith in myself
	and in the higher power who is constantly working to keep us moving forward and bringing us to greater awareness.<br />
	So, Joyce, my friend and guide, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and eternal gratitude for the unselfish way you share of yourself and time to make other lives better. 
	It is truly a great service you provide.
	For any and all of you who are seeking a new way or new path in life, I highly recommend that you reach out to Joyce as I did.<br />
