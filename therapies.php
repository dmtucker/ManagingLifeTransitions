<h3 id="hypnosis">HYPNOSIS</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:40px;">
	Our conscious minds are constantly chattering away, keeping up an endless commentary about life, our problems, our feelings and attitudes. 
	Is it any wonder we have a society that increasingly experiences anxiety and panic attacks, stress and other health problems&mdash;both physical and emotional?<br />
	<br />
	Hypnosis is the direct path to the subconscious mind where those blocks and limitations are stored.
	Through the use of hypnosis, the conscious mind can be bypassed and the healing powers of the subconscious mind accessed.<br />
	<br />
	Because hypnotherapy works directly with the subconscious mind, positive results can be achieved very quickly.
	The average length of treatment is 4 to 6 sessions.<br />

	<span style="font-weight:bold;">FAQ</span><br />
	<span style="color:#F30;">Q:</span> Will I be completely &quot;out&quot; during the session?<br />

	<br />
	<span style="color:#F30;">Q:</span> Can I be made to say or do things against my will?<br />
	<span style="color:#F30;">A:</span> Absolutely not! You are always in control, and cannot be made to speak or behave in a way that is contrary to your own values and beliefs.<br />
	<br />
	<span style="color:#F30;">Q:</span> Does hypnosis really work?<br />

	<br />
	<span style="color:#F30;">Q:</span> Do I have to do anything, or will hypnosis do it all for me?<br />
	<span style="color:#F30;">A:</span> Hypnosis is a very effective process for achieving personal and professional goals. It is not, however, a Magic Wand. 
	It is simply a tool to help you achieve your goals.<br />

<h3 id="igi">INTERACTIVE GUIDED IMAGERY&trade;</h3>
<p>
	Imagery is the window to our inner world.
	Interactive Guided Imagery is a two-way process of communication between our silent, subconscious mind and our verbal, conscious mind. 
	It is a way of looking at our own ideas, feelings and interpretations of life by accessing a flow of thoughts that can be felt, heard, smelled, seen or tasted. 
	By connecting with the healing powers of the subconscious mind, changes can be achieved by looking at our fears and blocks and then transforming them.<br />
